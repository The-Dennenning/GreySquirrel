   <h3>
    This is where new and featured content will appear
   </h3>
   <p>
    Yeah, we'll have lots of stuff to show here, so check for updates! For now, this is just sample text. Cuz I need lots of sample text, just to check out how the look looks. I'm testing fonts at the moment, so I need some sort of content here to instantiate the fonts.
   </p>
   <p class="boxed">
    This text will appear in a nice little rounded box, and it will have a different font. This is the style I use to quote stuff!
   </p>
   <p>
    Yeah, you like how that boxed text up there looks? Isn't that snazzy?
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyways, text.
